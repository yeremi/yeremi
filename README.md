### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yeremi Loli, a PHP Developer and WordPress Engineer crafting digital experiences from Germany. Currently, I'm helping build the future of web development at Syde GmbH, where I architect scalable solutions that push the boundaries of what's possible with WordPress.

#### What I Do

I specialize in developing web applications with a focus on:
- Enterprise WordPress Development
- Backend System Architecture
- API Integrations
- Performance Optimization


#### Open Source Impact

I'm passionate about giving back to the developer community through open-source contributions. Here are some of my key projects:

##### Schema Mapper
A powerful PHP library that transforms complex API responses into clean, type-safe PHP objects using attributes. It simplifies data handling and reduces boilerplate code, making integration work more efficient and maintainable.

##### Stopwords
A comprehensive library for text processing and analysis, providing robust tools for managing and filtering stopwords across multiple languages. Perfect for applications requiring natural language processing or content optimization.

##### WP Ingresso
A custom WordPress plugin designed to integrate with the Ingresso API (Brazil), fetching movie data and dynamically displaying it on your WordPress site. Built using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, this plugin ensures modularity, scalability, and easy maintenance.

#### Let's Connect!

I'm always excited to collaborate on interesting projects or discuss innovative solutions. Feel free to explore my repositories or reach out if you'd like to work together!
